            <p>A goal can be something a person want to achieve, maintain or avoid in life or it can mean a life which is more colorful or meaningful of one's own way. there can be large and challenging ones or sometimes its special but rather small and more of a personal achievement. As for my goal, i want to be a better human, better person for me and my family. I wanna be a better version of my yesterdays and an inspiration of my tomorrows. I want to live my life with those person i care about. I want to give people the hope they need and the pathway they'll walk onwards.</p>
